# About Movie Booking Application:

This project is a fundamental version of a Movie Booking Application. Users have to select their respective seats from the 3 mentioned auditoriums and proceed to pay for them. The application will notify if the seats mentioned by the user are available to book or not. The seats booked by user will incur a service tax of `14%` with other two taxes at `0.5%` each. The application will also show the total sales of all the tickets in all the 3 auditoriums along with the respective accumulation of taxes.


## Important notes:

1) This application is designed to ignore every input of the user, apart from the auditorium seat numbers.

2) The auditorium seat numbers should be separated by a `comma`.
